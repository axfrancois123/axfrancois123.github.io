            According to our graph, we can see that the highest concentration of windspeed is around 0-5 mph however there are a few outliers that 
            have high windspeeds of 35 mph. The windspeeds will be lower around these countries because of the warm and humid client theses countries possess. These countries
            are also near large bodies of water as well. The reason why windspeeds are almost non existent in countries in latitude -60 and on is because those are northern 
            countries Siberia, Norway, Finland, Russia and many others. These countries have a colder consistent climate.
